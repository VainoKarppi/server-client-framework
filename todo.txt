Add More events???

Check for each parameter and make sure the type is same as on receiver method and check amount

Remove from JsonSerializer and use bytes instead: // sender, target, type, is class, key, methodname?
And then use JsonSerializer for parameters only (not required either, since we have parse parameters array)



TODO send client METHODS only if requested by server


handle handshake timeout better


ClientMethodInfo parameter. Check if required or optional (Request data from client and vice verse)

REWORK OF THE WHOLE CLASS STRUCTURES

TODO make sure the socket is using serverframework
TODO create shared folder of shared methods with SERVER defines


Add simple encryption

remove handshake false if not used
remove original params from MSG
hash not shown
useclass = null to set false

if client disconnect using X set success false

Add timeout in events blocking methods

Handle if server uses throw in method when requesting data

Add ACK check ability on request data

When sending a request data wait for longer if ACK was returned before invoked method
todo add a list of waiting for incoming packets of keys. If not in list the reposne was too late and timeout happened before
